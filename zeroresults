## Answer by ChatGPT
GitHub’s message:

> **“results for repositories matching *software* sorted by last updated”**

means:

**GitHub is searching *repository names*, *descriptions*, and *topics* — NOT file names inside repositories.**

Your repository contains a file named:

```
EngineerTraining/SoftwareFactory
```

but the **repository itself** is *not* called “Software” and does *not* contain “software” in its name, description, or topics.

Therefore:

### ✅ **`SoftwareFactory` appears in the *files* of your repo**

* e.g.,
  `https://github.com/kaizen-nagoya/EngineerTraining/blob/main/SoftwareFactory`

### ❌ **But GitHub’s repository search does NOT search inside file names**

* So your repository **won’t be listed** when searching repositories for “software”.

# ✔ Why it happens

GitHub’s **search bar at the top** performs repository search like this:

* Looks for text in:

  * **Repository names**
  * **Repository descriptions**
  * **Repository topics (tags)**
* **Does NOT search file names inside repos**
* **Does NOT search file contents** (unless you explicitly click “Code search”)

So when you search:

```
software
```

GitHub shows:

> repositories **matching software**

Your repo **EngineerTraining** does not match because:

* Name: `EngineerTraining` → does not contain “software”
* Description: (likely empty or unrelated)
* Topics: none contain “software”

So **it is expected behavior**.

# ✔ How to make your repository appear in such searches

You have three options:

### **1. Add “software” to the repository description**

Go to your repo → **Settings → General → Description**

Add something like:

```
Software engineering training materials
```

### **2. Add “software” as a repository Topic**

Go to the repo → top right area → *“Add topics”*

Add:

```
software
software-factory
software-engineering
```

### **3. Rename the repository** (optional)

Name it something including “software”:

```
EngineerTraining-SoftwareFactory
```

---

# ✔ If you want to search for files instead

Use:

```
softwarefactory in:path user:kaizen-nagoya
```

Or GitHub Code Search:

```
user:kaizen-nagoya SoftwareFactory
```

This *will* find files inside repositories.

If you tell me **what exactly you want to appear in search results**, I can suggest the simplest way to adjust your repo.
