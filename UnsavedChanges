# unsaved changes

## Request
Github said "You have unsaved changes. Do you want to discard them?" What happens when Github says so?
## Answer by CHatGPT
When GitHub shows the message:
> **“You have unsaved changes. Do you want to discard them?”**
it means **the page you are on contains edits or actions that you have not saved yet**, and GitHub is warning you that leaving the page will **erase those changes permanently**.
Here is what happens depending on your choice:
# ✅ If you click **“Discard” / “Leave Page”**
* All your unsaved edits are **lost**.
* GitHub returns to the previous page or reloads the current page.
* You **cannot recover** the text once discarded (unless you copied it manually).
# ✅ If you click **“Stay on Page”**
* You remain on the page *with your unsaved edits preserved*.
* You can:
  * continue editing
  * save (commit) your changes
  * copy them before leaving
# 🔍 Why GitHub shows this warning
GitHub triggers this when:
* You are editing a **file** (web editor)
* You are writing an **issue**, **pull request**, or **comment**
* You are editing a **wiki page**
* You are configuring **settings** and haven’t clicked “Save”
This is a browser-level warning GitHub activates when it detects:
* unsubmitted form data
* unsaved content in the text editor
* pending changes that will be lost if you navigate away
# 💡 Good practice
Before leaving the page:
* **Copy your text somewhere** (clipboard or text editor)
* Or **commit** (save) your changes
This avoids accidental data loss if your browser refreshes or closes.
If you want, tell me **where exactly** you saw the warning (file editor, issue, PR, Wiki), and I can explain more precisely what would be lost in that specific case.
## Request
Code in main.
## Answer by CHatGPT
If you mean **“I was editing code in the `main` branch when GitHub said ‘You have unsaved changes’”**, here is what it means:
# ✅ What “You have unsaved changes” means when editing code in `main`
When you edit a file directly in GitHub’s web editor on the **main branch**, GitHub tracks your typing.
If you try to:
* refresh the page
* close the tab
* switch branches
* open another file
* click back
GitHub shows:
> **You have unsaved changes. Do you want to discard them?**
This warning appears **before you commit**, because your edits are only in the browser — not saved to the repository yet.
# 🔥 **Important: Nothing is saved to the `main` branch until you click “Commit changes”**
So:
### If you click **Discard / Leave**
* Your code edits are **deleted**
* `main` stays unchanged
* Nothing is committed
### If you click **Stay on Page**
* Your code edits **remain in the editor**
* You can still commit them to `main`
* Or copy the text before leaving
# 🌱 Best practice when editing directly on `main`
Because `main` is the primary branch:
### Option A — Commit directly (small edits)
If the change is simple (typo fix, small text change):
1. Edit the file
2. Click **“Commit changes”**
3. Choose **Commit directly to main**
### Option B — Use a branch (safer)
For bigger edits:
1. Click “Create a new branch for this commit”
2. Make a pull request
3. Merge after checking
This avoids overwriting or conflicting with others’ work (and your own past edits).
# If you meant something different
If “Code in main.” was a shorthand for another question (e.g., *“Why am I editing in main?”*, or *“Should I commit to main?”*), tell me and I’ll answer precisely.

## Request
When I add a URL in main. How to fix commit conflicts when editing main?
## Answer by CHatGPT
When you add a **URL** (or make any small edit) directly in **main** on GitHub, you can sometimes get a **commit conflict**. This usually happens because **the file changed after you opened it**, so GitHub is protecting the newer content.
Below is the **clean, simple workflow** to fix the conflict.
# ✅ **How to Fix Commit Conflicts When Editing `main` (GitHub Web UI)**
## **Method 1 — Refresh, Re-edit, Commit (simplest)**
If it's a small edit such as adding a URL:
1. **Copy your added text** (the URL)
2. Click Back or Reload → GitHub will show:
   > “You have unsaved changes”
3. Click **Leave Page**
4. The file reloads with the **latest version**
5. **Edit the file again**, paste your URL
6. Click **Commit changes → Commit directly to main**
This resolves 90% of web-editor conflicts.
# ✅ **Method 2 — Use GitHub’s "Resolve conflicts"**
If GitHub detects a real conflict, it shows a message:
> **This branch has conflicts that must be resolved**
Steps:
1. Click **Resolve conflicts**
2. GitHub shows both versions:
```
   <<<<<<< main
   (your version)
   =======
   (newest version)
   >>>>>>> updated
```
3. Edit the block so it contains the correct final text
4. Click **Mark as resolved**
5. Commit the merge
# ✅ **Method 3 — Create a Branch (safer, no conflicts)**
Instead of editing `main`:
1. Open the file → click **Edit**
2. Make your change
3. In the commit box:
   ✔ Select **“Create a new branch for this commit”**
4. Submit a pull request
5. Merge it into `main`
Because the branch is based on the latest commit, there are **no conflicts**.
# ✅ **Why conflicts happen when adding a URL**
Even if you touch only one line:
* Someone (or you in another tab) committed a change to the same file
* GitHub Actions or Dependabot updated the repo
* You edited the file from an **old page view**
* You opened the editor, then returned an hour later (file changed during that time)
GitHub refuses the commit because it could overwrite newer data.
# 📌 **Preventing Conflicts**
Do these before editing `main`:
✔ Refresh the page before clicking “Edit”
✔ Ensure no other tab is editing the same file
✔ Use branches for anything more than a one-line fix
✔ Pull or reload before committing (if using local git)
# If you want, tell me:
* Which file you edited
* What URL you added
* Whether GitHub showed “Resolve conflicts” or a different error
…and I can walk you through the exact fix for your situation.
## Request
Next, Gidhub said "There was an error committing your changes: kaizen-nagoya has committed since you started editing. See what changed." I am kaizen-nagoya.
## Answer by CHatGPT
This message:
> **“There was an error committing your changes: kaizen-nagoya has committed since you started editing. See what changed.”**
means:
### ✔ GitHub is telling you:
**“The file has changed *after* you opened the editor. Your edit is based on an old version, so we cannot commit it.”**
Even though **you** are kaizen-nagoya, GitHub treats this the same as “someone else changed the file.”
This happens frequently with the GitHub web editor.
Let me explain clearly **why it happens** and **how to fix it immediately.**
# ✅ Why it happens (even if *you* made the commit)
GitHub triggers this error when:
### **1. You opened the file editor in one tab**
…and then **made another commit in a different tab** or earlier.
When you return to the old tab and try to commit, GitHub says:
* “That file is outdated.”
* “Newer commits exist.”
### **2. GitHub auto-updated something**
Examples:
* Dependabot created a commit
* GitHub Actions modified files
* You updated README or another file in the same repo
* You edited the same file 20 minutes earlier in another tab
### **3. You edited an old cached page**
Sometimes browsers keep an older version of the page.
GitHub compares it to the latest version → conflict.
# ✅ How to fix it (step by step, simplest way)
### **Step 1 — Copy your new text**
Copy your URL, sentence, or edits.
### **Step 2 — Refresh the page**
This loads the newest version.
### **Step 3 — Click “Edit this file” again**
### **Step 4 — Paste your changes and commit again**
This solves the problem in almost every case.
# ✅ Alternative fix (if GitHub shows conflict UI)
Sometimes GitHub gives a link:
> **“See what changed.”**
If you click it, GitHub shows the diff.
Then use:
### **“Edit file → Try again”**
or
### **“Resolve conflicts”** (if available)
# 🔥 If you want to avoid this problem in the future
### Best practice:
👉 **Do not keep GitHub web editor open more than a few minutes.**
👉 **Do not edit multiple tabs of the same repo at once.**
👉 **Refresh before editing.**
If you do longer edits, use branches:
1. Edit file
2. Choose: **“Create new branch for this commit”**
3. Make a PR
4. Merge
Branches avoid this “someone committed after you” error completely.
# If you want, tell me:
* The repository name
* The file you were editing
* Whether this happened multiple times
…I can tell you the exact cause and help you prevent it.

## Answer by CHatGPT
Thanks for sharing those links. If I understand correctly: you edited a file on branch **main** in your repo githuberrro (user “kaizen‑nagoya”), and then got the error:
> “There was an error committing your changes: kaizen-nagoya has committed since you started editing. See what changed.”
Here’s what likely happened and how to proceed, with details customized for your repo.
## 🔍 What likely happened in your case
* You opened one of the files: either `errors` or `zeroresults` (you linked both) under `main`.
* While you were editing, *another commit* was pushed to `main`. That commit could have been by you (in another window/tab), a workflow/automation, or any contributor.
* Because the file you opened became **out-of-date**, GitHub blocked your new commit to avoid overwriting changes you didn’t see.
* The message “See what changed” invites you to check the diff of what was added in the meantime.
## ✅ How to fix it step-by-step for your repo
Here’s a safe sequence:
1. **Copy your pending edits** (the URL you wanted to add) from the editor.
2. Click the link **“See what changed”** (if displayed) to view the diff of new changes to the file.
3. Close the editor (you may get the “You have unsaved changes” warning) — choose to stay, copy, then leave or discard.
4. Reload the file in `main` (go to the repo → main branch → file).
5. Click **Edit this file** again.
6. Paste your URL/add your changes.
7. In the commit area, ensure it says “Commit directly to the main branch”.
8. Commit the change.
This way your edit is based on the latest version, so no conflict.
## 🛡 Additional suggestions
* If you expect you’ll make many edits (or large ones), consider **creating a branch** instead of editing `main` directly.
* Always **reload the file before editing** if you had it open for some time.
* Check if any **automated workflow** (e.g., CI, bot) might be committing to the same file/branch unbeknownst to you, causing updates while you edit.
If you like, I can **check the commit history** for your repo and show exactly which commit happened after you opened the file (so you can see what changed). Would you like me to do that?
## Request
please.
## Answer by CHatGPT
I was unable to locate a **recent commit** to the file(s) in question in your repo githuberrro (under user kaizen‑nagoya) that clearly shows exactly *after you started editing* and before your attempted commit.
Would you like me to check with a more detailed filter (e.g., time-stamp, branch history) so we can pinpoint the exact commit that caused the “committed since you started editing” message?
